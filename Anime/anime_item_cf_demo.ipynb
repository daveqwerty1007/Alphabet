    "# Anime Item-Based Collaborative Filtering Recommender System\n",
    "\n",
    "This notebook builds a simple **item‑based collaborative filtering (CF) model** for recommending anime titles.\n",
    "\n",
    "The goal is to simulate how a recommender system could be built when you don't have access to user identifiers during cold‑start (e.g., during onboarding). Instead of finding similar users, the model recommends new titles based on the similarities between the items themselves (anime series).\n",
    "\n",
    "In a real production scenario you would start from large tables like `animelist.csv`, `rating_complete.csv` and `anime.csv`. Those files contain tens of millions of user interactions and rich metadata. For illustration purposes this notebook creates a **tiny synthetic dataset** that follows the same structure but is small enough to run quickly.  You can later replace the synthetic data with the full datasets once they are available.\n"

    "\n",
    "This simple example illustrates how to build an item‑based collaborative filtering recommender system.  The key steps are:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Load and clean the data.**  Filter out incomplete or low‑quality ratings.  In this notebook we used a synthetic dataset for demonstration purposes.\n",
    "2. **Construct the user–item matrix.**  Each column represents an anime and each row a user.  Missing values are typically filled with zeros or the mean rating for that item.\n",
    "3. **Compute item–item similarities.**  Cosine similarity is a common choice.  For large datasets you would use a sparse matrix representation and consider approximate methods for scalability.\n",
    "4. **Generate recommendations.**  Aggregate the similarity scores for items the user has already rated, apply weighting by the user's own ratings, exclude items already seen, and pick the top candidates.\n",
    "\n",
    "To adapt this system for production use, consider the following improvements:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Use the full `rating_complete.csv` dataset** to build a high‑quality similarity matrix, ensuring that only strong signals (completed anime with scores) are used.\n",
    "- **Experiment with normalization techniques** such as centering ratings by user or by item, or applying TF–IDF weighting to penalize very popular titles.\n",
    "- **Incorporate additional metadata** (genres, release year, etc.) as features for hybrid models, or to diversify recommendations.\n",
    "- **Optimize performance** by using approximate nearest neighbor libraries (e.g., `annoy`, `faiss`) or precomputing the top k similar items offline.\n",
    "\n",
    "Because the dataset used here is small, the recommendations may not always match real‑world preferences.  However, the core workflow remains the same when scaling up to millions of users and items.\n"
